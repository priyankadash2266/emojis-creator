Emojis or avatars are ways to indicate nonverbal cues. These cues have become an essential part of online chatting, product review, brand emotion, and many more. It also lead to increasing data science research dedicated to emoji-driven storytelling.

With advancements in computer vision and deep learning, it is now possible to detect human emotions from images. In this deep learning project, i classify human facial expressions to filter and map corresponding emojis or avatars.

summary:

In this deep learning project , i have built a convolution neural network to recognize facial emotions. I have trained omy model on the FER2013 dataset. Then mapping those emotions with the corresponding emojis or avatars.

Using OpenCVâ€™s haar cascade xml we are getting the bounding box of the faces in the webcam. Then we feed these boxes to the trained model for classification.
